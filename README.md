# bundle-test

`react`, `emotion` and `@spokeo/styleguide` are included.

To use it:
1. clone it;
2. `yarn install` & `yarn start` for local dev;
3. create your page or section in `/src/App.js`;
4. sample data is accessible globally via variable `data`;
5. If youâ€™re satisfy with the result, run `yarn build` to generate the bundled html & js. (They are `index.html` and `main.js` in `/dist` folder).
